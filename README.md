## Overview

[Overview]: #overview

This repository contains Battlescribe formatted data for a 10th edition version of the 2019 Apocalypse Game System. This is based off the work from 9th edition by Fundamalleus and many other community members to bring the system into 9th edition. The original Apocalypse Datasheets (based off of 8th edition 40k) don't accurately represent the current rules and themes of modern armies (Thousand Sons being very slow, Daemon Engines hitting on 4s, Force Orginization being completely alien to the current edition, Firstborn Space Marines still having 1W, etc).

### Can I use this in my Battlescribe app?

Yes! The files are downloadable directly through github. Below are instructions to add the data on PC and Mobile.

On PC

1. Click Manage Data (three rectangles)
2. Click Import Data
3. Click Import Data from URL
4. Paste our [Data URL][latestRelease]

On Mobile

1. Tap Manage Data (three rectangles)
2. Tap the 3 dots
3. Tap Add data index url
4. Paste our [Data URL][latestRelease]

### How did you create the new datasheets?

Our baseline datasheet is the Tactial Squad where `T4` `Sv 3+` is `Sv 6+`, and a boltgun is `SAP 7+`, `SAT 9+`. In general we try to follow the following rules for converting the datasheets, then follow up by tweak and changing values as needed through playtesting and feedback.

> #### Wounds
> For every 5 wounds in a unit, the unit gets 1 wound in the apoc datasheet
>
> #### Attacks
> For every 3A of a weapon in a unit, the unit gets 1A
>
> #### Points
> Every 20 points is equivalent to 1PL
